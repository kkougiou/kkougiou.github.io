abstract: Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) play a critical role in providing ecosystem
  services through their provision of herbal remedies, food and natural skin care
  products, their integration into local economies, and maintaining pollinators’ diversity
  and populations and ecosystem functioning. Mountainous regions, such as Chelmos-Vouraikos
  National Park (CVNP), represent unique reservoirs of endemic MAP diversity that
  require conservation prioritisation. This study aims to provide insights into the
  sustainable management of MAPs, contributing to efforts to protect Mediterranean
  biodiversity amid the dual challenges of climate and land-use change, using a suite
  of macroecological modelling techniques. Following a Species Distribution Modelling
  framework, we investigated the vulnerability of endemic and non-endemic MAPs to
  climate and land-use changes. We examined the potential shifts in MAP diversity,
  distribution, and conservation hotspots within the CVNP. Our results revealed species-specific
  responses, with endemic taxa facing severe range contractions and non-endemic taxa
  initially expanding but eventually declining, particularly under land-use change
  scenarios. Local biodiversity hotspots are projected to shift altitudinally, with
  considerable area losses in the coming decades and elevated species turnover predicted
  throughout the CVNP, leading to biotic homogenization. Climate and land-use changes
  jointly threaten MAP diversity, calling for adaptive conservation strategies, thus
  highlighting the importance of proactive measures, such as awareness raising, establishing
  plant micro-reserves, assisted translocation, and promoting …
