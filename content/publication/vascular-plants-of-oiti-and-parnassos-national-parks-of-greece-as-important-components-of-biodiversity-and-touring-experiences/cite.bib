  abstract = {National Parks represent natural ecosystems whose biodiversity endows them not only with spectacular ecological and scientific value but also with a rich aesthetic and cultural value. Other apparent benefits of National Parks are in their potential for biodiversity conservation and in their appeal to visitors and tourism, and particularly the kind that is concerned with learning about nature and the environment. In this paper, we present the work being done for the AdVENt project, which focuses on researching a particular region of the Parnassos and Oiti National Parks in Greece, with a remarkably diverse endemic flora, and in developing innovative applications in order to enhance the tourism experience in protected areas of particular environmental interest. AdVENt aims to provide technologically advanced multimedia solutions and high-quality content, highlighting the natural beauty of the region.},
