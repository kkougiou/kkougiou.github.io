abstract: In the Anthropocene, conservation planning must adapt to rapid environmental
  changes driving the global biodiversity crisis. The impacts of climate and land-use
  change are particularly severe in biodiversity hotspots like the Mediterranean Basin,
  where unique taxa and ecosystems are increasingly at risk. To address these challenges,
  we conducted a forward-looking conservation prioritization analysis in Peloponnese,
  Greece, a regional endemism center and key component of the Mediterranean biodiversity
  hotspot. Our aim was to map plant biodiversity conservation gaps and provide a case
  study for developing a cost-effective conservation strategy. We conducted a taxonomically
  and phylogenetically informed identification of endemism hotspots. Furthermore,
  we mapped persistent hotspots under multiple future scenarios of environmental change
  and assessed their coverage by protected and roadless areas. Our analysis revealed
  that endemism hotspots will likely shift geographically and diminish in extent over
  the coming decades. While key mountainous regions are expected to retain their hotspot
  status until the end of the century, our results indicate an overall endemism decline
  and a high likelihood of extinctions. Moreover, up to 46% of the persistent endemism
  hotspots are not covered by current protected areas, and less than 8% of those are
  within roadless areas. Our results highlight the need for a coordinated multi-dimensional
  strategy that should include the expansion of the current network of protected areas,
  the establishment of plant micro-reserves, and the translocation and reinforcement
  of populations of endemics. The â€¦
