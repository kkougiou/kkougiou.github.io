abstract: This study assesses for the first time all the vascular endemic plant taxa
  of Greece, according to their decline and rarity. Phylogenetic analysis and its
  spatial overview highlight areas for conservation prioritization. Several of the
  Greek endemics are threatened with extinction and fourteen of them need to be prioritized,
  due to their evolutionary distinctiveness. This assessment could act as the baseline
  and supporting tool for conservation actions, decision- and policy-making for biodiversity,
  while highlighting the need for a new Red Data Book for the Greek flora.Human-induced
  biodiversity decline has been on the rise for the past 250 years, due to various
  causes. What is equally troubling, is that we are unaware which plants are threatened
  and where they occur. Thus, we are far from reaching Aichi Biodiversity Target 2,
  i.e., assessing the extinction risk of most species. To that end, based on an extensive
  occurrence dataset, we performed an extinction risk assessment according to the
  IUCN Criteria A and B for all the endemic plant taxa occurring in Greece, one of
  the most biodiverse countries in Europe, in a phylogenetically-informed framework
  and identified the areas needing conservation prioritization. Several of the Greek
  endemics are threatened with extinction and fourteen endemics need to be prioritized,
  as they are evolutionary distinct and globally endangered. Mt. Gramos is identified
  as the most important conservation hotspot in Greece. However, a significant portion
  of the identified conservation hotspots is not included in any designated Greek
  protected area, meaning that the â€¦
