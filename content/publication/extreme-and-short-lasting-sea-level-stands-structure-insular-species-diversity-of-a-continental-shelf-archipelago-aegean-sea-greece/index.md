abstract: 'Recent research in island biogeography has highlighted the important role
  of late Quaternary sea-level fluctuations in shaping biogeographical patterns in
  insular systems, but largely focused on volcanic oceanic systems. Through this study
  we aim to extend this work by investigating the role of late Quaternary sea-level
  fluctuations in shaping species richness patterns in continental shelf island systems.
  Focusing on the Aegean archipelago, we first reconstructed the area’s geography
  using published data, under three sea-level stands: 1) current; 2) median over the
  last nine Glacial-Interglacial cycles; 3) Late Glacial Maximum (LGM). We compiled
  taxon-island occupancy for angiosperms (70 islands) and centipedes (56 islands).
  We investigated the impact of present-day and past geographical settings on chorological
  groups by analysing Island Species-Area Relationships (ISARs) and using Generalized
  Linear Mixed Models selection based on multiple metrics of goodness-of-fit. Our
  results confirm that the Aegean’s geography has changed dramatically since the LGM,
  while the median sea-level scenario only modestly differs from the present configuration.
  Paleogeographical changes largely shaped Aegean plant diversity patterns, and to
  a lesser degree centipede species richness patterns. The LGM geographic configuration
  affected both native and endemic species diversity through establishing connections
  between land-bridge islands and the mainland. Particularly on land-bridge islands
  we detected supersaturation of native species and stronger underrepresentation of
  endemics on those same islands. Unlike oceanic islands, where the …'
