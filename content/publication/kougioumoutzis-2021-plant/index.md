abstract: 'We identified the plant endemism centres and biodiversity hotspots in Greece, using a dataset of 1855 endemic taxa and 7465 native taxa. We employed a wide array of biodiversity metrics and biogeographical analyses to identify the areas of high endemic and native plant diversity. We found that the endemic and native plant diversity patterns are spatially decoupled. The areas of high endemic plant diversity are located in the southern part of Greece, while the areas of high native plant diversity are located in the northern part of Greece. The endemic plant diversity patterns are strongly influenced by the geological history of the region, while the native plant diversity patterns are strongly influenced by the current environmental conditions.'
