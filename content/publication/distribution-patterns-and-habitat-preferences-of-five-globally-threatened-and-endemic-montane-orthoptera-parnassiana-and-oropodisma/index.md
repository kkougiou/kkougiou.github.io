abstract: 'Greece is a European hotspot for Orthoptera (378 species), yet it has been
  scarcely explored. We investigated the distribution and habitat preferences of the
  species of two endemic Orthoptera genera, Parnassiana and Oropodisma, in the montane
  ecosystems of central Greece. We conducted field surveys from 2021 to 2024 in 174
  sites across seven mountains. The species of both genera preferred habitats above
  1500 m, with species-specific preferences for microhabitat parameters: Parnassiana
  species favored moderate slopes with dense shrub cover, while Oropodisma species
  favored substrates with intermediate stone cover and relatively high vegetation
  cover. Species distribution models estimated the area of suitable habitat for Parnassiana
  to be at 5 km2 and Oropodisma at 3.28 km2. The Normalized Difference Vegetation
  Index (NDVI) and potential evapotranspiration were the key environmental drivers
  of the habitat suitability for both genera. Generalized regression models showed
  that altitude positively influenced Parnassiana population density, peaking at 2200
  m, whereas rock and soil cover negatively impacted Oropodisma population densities.
  The results emphasize the critical role of montane habitats in sustaining these
  species and provide essential data for future research and conservation strategies.'
