  abstract = {Astragalus maniaticus and Aethionema saxatile subsp. corinthiacum have vague taxonomic relationships. Astragalus maniaticus was placed in sect. Hypoglottis but shows affinities to A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii of sect. Platyglottis. The Aethionema saxatile complex is an intriguing group due to the wide distribution and morphological variability of its taxa. In order to elucidate the variation patterns of these two taxa and to test their morphological identity, we carried out several multivariate morphometric (stepwise canonical and classificatory) analyses. They revealed that Astragalus maniaticus cannot be distinguished from A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii on morphological grounds. Therefore, it is transferred to sect. Platyglottis and regarded a heterotypic synonym of A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii. The taxonomic interpretation of Aethionema saxatile subsp. corinthiacum necessitated a broad revision of the Ae …},
