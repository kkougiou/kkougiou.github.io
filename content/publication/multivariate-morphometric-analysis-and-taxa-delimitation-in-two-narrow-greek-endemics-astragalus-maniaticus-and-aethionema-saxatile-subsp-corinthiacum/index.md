abstract: Astragalus maniaticus and Aethionema saxatile subsp. corinthiacum have vague
  taxonomic relationships. Astragalus maniaticus was placed in sect. Hypoglottis but
  shows affinities to A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii of sect. Platyglottis. The Aethionema
  saxatile complex is an intriguing group due to the wide distribution and morphological
  variability of its taxa. In order to elucidate the variation patterns of these two
  taxa and to test their morphological identity, we carried out several multivariate
  morphometric (stepwise canonical and classificatory) analyses. They revealed that
  Astragalus maniaticus cannot be distinguished from A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii
  on morphological grounds. Therefore, it is transferred to sect. Platyglottis and
  regarded a heterotypic synonym of A. suberosus subsp. haarbachii. The taxonomic
  interpretation of Aethionema saxatile subsp. corinthiacum necessitated a broad revision
  of the Ae â€¦
