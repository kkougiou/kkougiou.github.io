abstract: ' Orthoptera species are vulnerable to extinction on a global scale. Greece
  hosts 35% (380 species) of the European Orthoptera fauna with a high degree of endemic
  (37%) and threatened species (37%). We sampled 46 plots (100 m2) to investigate
  the distribution and ecological requirement of two Greek mountain endemic and red‐listed
  species: Parnassiana parnassica (Ramme, 1926; Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae; Critically
  Endangered [CR]) and Oropodisma parnassica (Scudder, 1897; Orthoptera: Caelifera;
  Endangered [EN]). Species had a restricted geographical range, with two isolated
  populations confined to high altitudes (1527–2320 m) of Mts. Parnassos and Elikonas.
  Species distribution models showed that slope affected their suitable habitat, together
  with the topographic position index and the annual temperature range (P. parnassica),
  and the amount of green vegetation and evapotranspiration (O …'
