abstract: The Mediterranean hot spot includes numerous endemic and socio-economically
  important plant species seriously threatened by climate change and habitat loss.
  In this study, the genetic diversity of five populations of Cicer graecum, an endangered
  endemic species from northern Peloponnisos, Greece and a wild relative of the cultivated
  Cicer arietinum, was investigated using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) and
  amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in order to determine levels
  and structure of genetic variability. Nei’s gene diversity by ISSR and AFLP markers
  indicated medium to high genetic diversity at the population level. Moreover, AMOVA
  results suggest that most of the variation exists within (93 % for AFLPs and 65
  % for ISSRs), rather than among populations. Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis
  based on ISSRs positively correlated the genetic differentiation among …
