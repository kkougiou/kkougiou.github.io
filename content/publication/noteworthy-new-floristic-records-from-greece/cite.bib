  abstract = {This contribution to the Greek flora includes distribution extensions and    taxonomic notes for some noteworthy plant taxa. New records for certain    phytogeographical regions of Greece are presented for: Arum cylindraceum,    Convolvulus pentapetaloides. Cruciata taurica, Galanthus reginae-olgae    subsp. vernalis, Ilex aquifolium, Linum decumbens, Lythrum thymifolia, Sedum    praesidis, Silene congesta and Trifolium diffusum. Allium karistanum,    Helichrysum amorginum, Limonium antipaxorum and L. cephalonicum have been    recorded for the first time on some islands. New populations of Allium    maniaticum and A. ritsii, previously known only from their loci classici,    were discovered in the Peloponnese. Valeriana alliariifolia, Silene    auriculata subsp. auriculata and Symphytum creticum were rediscovered in    central Evvia, confirming long-lost historical records from previous    centuries. The presence of V. alliariifolia in Greece and Europe is    confirmed for the first time since the 19th century.},
