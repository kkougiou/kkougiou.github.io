abstract: Climate change is one of the major threats to plant diversity and is expected
  to force species distributions into latitudinal or altitudinal shifts. The complex
  biology of orchids, and their many interactions with other organisms, increases
  their vulnerability in a changing climate. This study focuses on how climatic alterations
  will affect the distribution of the fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera L.), one of the
  most well-known and distinctive Ophrys species in Europe, using models that predict
  the species range changes in the future, based on environmental factors. The orchid’s
  environmentally suitable area is projected to shift northwards but downhill in the
  future, experiencing a moderate overall range contraction. More specifically in
  near- and long-term future, it is expected to be lost in South Europe, especially
  from the Balkans, while it will gain areas in North Europe, with the UK, Scandinavia,
  and the Baltic countries being among the winners. These results, although conservative
  since they are based only on abiotic variables, provide useful insights on the fly
  orchid’s response to future climatic change, and can serve as a basis for further
  studies on a finer scale.Numerous orchid species around the world have already been
  affected by the ongoing climate change, displaying phenological alterations and
  considerable changes to their distributions. The fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera
  L.) is a well-known and distinctive Ophrys species in Europe, with a broad distribution
  across the continent. This study explores the effects of climate change on the range
  of O. insectifera, using a species distribution models …
