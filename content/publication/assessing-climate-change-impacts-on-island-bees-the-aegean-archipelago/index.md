abstract: In this study, we conducted, for the first time, an extensive climate change
  impact assessment of bee pollinators in the Aegean Islands, Greece, a regional bee
  hotspot in the Mediterranean. We located the current biodiversity and future extinction
  hotspots in the region and identified areas in urgent need for conservation prioritization,
  by undertaking an overlap analysis with the established protected areas network
  in Greece. Most bee species occurring in the archipelago are expected to face severe
  range contractions and there is evidence of an underlying extinction debt in the
  study area. Our work could serve as the baseline for the integration of a rather
  neglected, yet extremely economically and ecologically important taxonomic group,
  the bees, in the systematic conservation planning in the archipelago.Pollinators’
  climate change impact assessments focus mainly on mainland regions. Thus, we are
  unaware how island species might fare in a rapidly changing world. This is even
  more pressing in the Mediterranean Basin, a global biodiversity hotspot. In Greece,
  a regional pollinator hotspot, climate change research is in its infancy and the
  insect Wallacean shortfall still remains unaddressed. In a species distribution
  modelling framework, we used the most comprehensive occurrence database for bees
  in Greece to locate the bee species richness hotspots in the Aegean, and investigated
  whether these might shift in the future due to climate change and assessed the Natura
  2000 protected areas network effectiveness. Range contractions are anticipated for
  most taxa, becoming more …
