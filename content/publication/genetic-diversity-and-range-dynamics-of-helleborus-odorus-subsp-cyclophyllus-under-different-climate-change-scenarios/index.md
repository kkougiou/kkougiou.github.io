abstract: 'Research Highlights: The effects of climate change on habitat loss, range
  shift and/or genetic impoverishment of mid-elevation plants has received less attention
  compared to alpine species. Moreover, genetic diversity patterns of mountain forest
  herbaceous species have scarcely been explored in the Balkans. In this context,
  our study is the first that aims to examine Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus,
  a medicinal plant endemic to the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula. Background
  and Objectives: We compare its genetic diversity and structure along the continuous
  mountain range of western Greece with the topographically less structured mountains
  of eastern Greece, and predict its present and future habitat suitability, using
  several environmental variables. Materials and Methods: Inter Simple Sequence Repeat
  (ISSR) markers were used to genotype 80 individuals from 8 populations, covering
  almost the species’ entire distribution range in Greece. We investigated the factors
  shaping its genetic composition and driving its current and future distribution.
  Results: High gene diversity (0.2239–0.3319), moderate population differentiation
  (0.0317–0.3316) and increased gene flow (Nm = 1.3098) was detected. According to
  any GCM/RCP/climate database combination, Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus
  is projected to lose a significant portion of its current distribution by 2070 and
  follow a trend towards genetic homogenization. Conclusions: Populations exhibit
  in terms of genetic structure a west–east genetic split, which becomes more evident
  southwards. This is mainly due to geographic/topographic factors and their interplay
