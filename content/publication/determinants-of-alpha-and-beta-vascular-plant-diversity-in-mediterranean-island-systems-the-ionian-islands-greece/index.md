abstract: The Ionian archipelago is the second largest Greek archipelago after the
  Aegean, but the factors driving plant species diversity in the Ionian islands are
  still barely known. We used stepwise multiple regressions to investigate the factors
  affecting plant species diversity in 17 Ionian islands. Generalized dissimilarity
  modelling was applied to examine variation in the magnitude and rate of species
  turnover along environmental gradients, as well as to assess the relative importance
  of geographical and climatic factors in explaining species turnover. The values
  of the residuals from the ISAR log10‐transfomed models of native and endemic taxa
  were used as a measure of island floristic diversity. Area was confirmed to be the
  most powerful single explanatory predictor of all diversity metrics. Mean annual
  precipitation and temperature, as well as shortest distance to the nearest island
  are also significant predictors of …
