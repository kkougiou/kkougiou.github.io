abstract: Aiming to cope with the provisions of Aichi Biodiversity Targets, EU Biodiversity
  Strategy and EU Green Deal, we conducted the first nationwide, phylogenetically
  informed identification of vascular plant diversity hotspots and endemism centres
  in Greece. By this, we identified the most important factors that shaped them, and
  assessed the effectiveness of the Special Areas of Conservation of the Natura 2000
  network in safeguarding them. Qualitative and quantitative results are provided
  and presented in thematic maps and relevant diagrams, highlighting areas of conservation
  importance, and identifying current protection scheme gaps. Simultaneously, our
  work contributes to national efforts for drafting Natura 2000 sites Management Plans,
  as well as to the MAES implementation in Greece.Biodiversity hotspots (BH) cover
  a small fraction of the Earth’s surface, yet host numerous endemics. Human-induced
  biodiversity loss has been increasing worldwide, despite attempts to halt the extinction
  crisis. There is thus an urgent need to efficiently allocate the available conservation
  funds in an optimised conservation prioritization scheme. Identifying BH and endemism
  centres (EC) is therefore a valuable tool in conservation prioritization and planning.
  Even though Greece is one of the most plant species-rich European countries, few
  studies have dealt with the identification of BH or EC and none has ever incorporated
  phylogenetic information or extended to the national scale. Consequently, we are
  unaware of the extent that Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) of the Natura 2000
  network …
