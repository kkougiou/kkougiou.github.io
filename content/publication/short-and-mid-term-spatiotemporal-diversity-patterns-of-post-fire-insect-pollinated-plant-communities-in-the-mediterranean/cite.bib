  abstract = {In the Mediterranean, one of the most fire-prone regions in the world, wildfires are considered a key factor in vegetation distribution, structure, and function. Severe or frequent fires can lead to homogenized plant communities and habitat fragmentation with significant consequences for the ecosystem and plant-dependent animals such as pollinators. Herein, we present the results of a 10-year post-fire study (2013â€“2022) conducted on Chios Island, Greece. We explored the effects of a large-scale fire on beta diversity patterns of the flowering insect-pollinated plant communities and its turnover and nestedness components in both burned and unburned sites. In addition, we investigated whether the recorded differences in the burned and unburned plant communities were a result of species gains or losses in the post-fire years. Burned communities display higher post-fire beta diversity compared to the unburned ones, due to higher species turnover across all years of reference. Species turnover was highest overall in the burned sites during the second post-fire year and decreased a decade later. In conclusion, Mediterranean flowering insect-pollinated plant communities are rather fire-resilient, implying positive impacts on pollinator diversity and plant-pollinator interactions during regeneration after a wildfire.},
