abstract: The small‐island effect (SIE) describes a different relationship between
  island area and species richness on smaller compared to larger islands. The pattern
  has recently gained widespread support. However, few studies have attempted to identify
  the actual mechanisms driving the SIE. Here, we use a phylogenetic community framework
  to study the SIE, based on the assumption that if the dominant assembly processes
  differ between small and large islands, patterns of phylogenetic community structure
  should shift across the area and habitat diversity gradient.The Aegean Archipelago,
  Greece.Plants.We used a large dataset of 3,262 vascular plant species distributed
  across 173 islands, in combination with a species‐level phylogeny. The phylogenetic
  community structure of each island was calculated using a null modelling framework
  and was quantified using effect sizes (ES …
