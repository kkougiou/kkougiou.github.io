abstract: 'Chelmos-Vouraikos National Park is a floristic diversity and endemism hotspot
  in Greece and one of the main areas where Greek endemic taxa, preliminary assessed
  as critically endangered and threatened under the IUCN Criteria A and B, are mainly
  concentrated. The climate and land-cover change impacts on rare and endemic species
  distributions is more prominent in regional biodiversity hotspots. The main aims
  of the current study were: (a) to investigate how climate and land-cover change
  may alter the distribution of four single mountain endemics and three very rare
  Peloponnesian endemic taxa of the National Park via a species distribution modelling
  approach, and (b) to estimate the current and future extinction risk of the aforementioned
  taxa based on the IUCN Criteria A and B, in order to investigate the need for designing
  an effective plant micro-reserve network and to support decision making on spatial
  planning efforts and conservation research for a sustainable, integrated management.
  Most of the taxa analyzed are expected to continue to be considered as critically
  endangered based on both Criteria A and B under all land-cover/land-use scenarios,
  GCM/RCP and time-period combinations, while two, namely Alchemilla aroanica and
  Silene conglomeratica, are projected to become extinct in most future climate change
  scenarios. When land-cover/land-use data were included in the analyses, these negative
  effects were less pronounced. However, Silene conglomeratica, the rarest mountain
  endemic found in the study area, is still expected to face substantial range decline.
  Our results highlight the urgent need for the establishment â€¦'
