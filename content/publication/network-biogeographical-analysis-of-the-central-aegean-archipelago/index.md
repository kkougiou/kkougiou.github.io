abstract: Although the factors shaping plant species richness patterns across the
  islands of the central Aegean are well known, the processes driving the assembly
  of these island communities remain unclear. To shed light on these processes, we
  identified biogeographical modules within the phytogeographical area of the Cyclades
  and tested for nestedness across the islands.The Cyclades, Greece.We used a network
  approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based on a large and
  detailed database of the Greek endemic plant taxa of the Cyclades, and we tested
  for nestedness in the island–species matrices.The Cyclades were significantly modular
  and divided into five biogeographical modules. Three of the modules were significantly
  nested and two displayed all four possible biogeographical roles (connectors, module
  hubs, network hubs, peripherals). Most of the …
