abstract: Climate- and land-use change stand as primary threats to terrestrial biodiversity.
  Yet, their synergistic impacts on species distributions remain poorly understood.
  To address this knowledge gap, we conducted the first-ever comprehensive species
  distribution analysis on an entire regional endemism centre within an eastern Mediterranean
  country, incorporating dynamic land-use/land-cover change data together with climate
  change scenarios. Specifically, we apply species distribution modelling and spatial
  data analysis techniques to compare the individual and synergistic effects of these
  environmental drivers on the endemic vascular flora of Peloponnese, focusing on
  potential range contractions, altitudinal shifts, and habitat fragmentation levels.
  Moreover, we identify fine-scale present and potential future endemism hotspots
  within our study area, incorporating taxonomic and phylogenetic information. Overall,
  we â€¦
