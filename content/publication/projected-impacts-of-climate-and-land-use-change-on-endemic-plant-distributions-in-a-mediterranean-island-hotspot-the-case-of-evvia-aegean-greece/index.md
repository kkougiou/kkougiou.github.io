abstract: Anthropogenic climate and land use change pose major threats to island floras
  worldwide, yet few studies have integrated these drivers in a single vulnerability
  assessment. Here, we examine the endemic flora of Evvia, the second-largest Aegean
  island in Greece and an important biodiversity hotspot, as a model system to address
  how these disturbances may reshape species distributions, community composition,
  and phylogenetic diversity patterns. We used species distribution models under the
  Ensemble of Small Models and the ENphylo framework, specifically designed to overcome
  parameter uncertainty in rare species with inherently limited occurrence records.
  By integrating climate projections and dynamic land use data, we forecasted potential
  range shifts, habitat fragmentation, and biodiversity patterns for 114 endemic taxa
  through the year 2100. We addressed transferability uncertainty, a key challenge
  in projecting distributions under novel conditions, using the Shape framework extrapolation
  analysis, thus ensuring robust model projections. Our findings reveal pronounced
  projected range contractions and increased habitat fragmentation for all studied
  taxa, with more severe impacts on single-island endemics. Our models demonstrated
  high concordance with established IUCN Red List assessments, validating their ecological
  relevance despite the sample size limitations of single-island endemics. Current
  biodiversity hotspots, primarily located in mountainous regions, are expected to
  shift towards lowland areas, probably becoming extinction hotspots due to projected
  species losses, especially for Evvia’s single-island endemics …
