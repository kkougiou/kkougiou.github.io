  abstract = {Since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)~ 21.5 kya, global sea-level rise has reshaped islands by contracting areas, fragmentation, and severing mainland connections. These changes led to supersaturation of island communities, triggering community relaxation through local extinctions. However, whether local extinctions occur randomly or deterministically remains unclear. Here, we integrate a paleo-coastline model with well-characterised squamate community data from 163 Mediterranean islands to assess how past geographical changes influenced community structure. We evaluate phylogenetic and functional community structure and test links to paleogeographic variables using multivariate regressions. Our findings suggest overdispersion dominates and is higher on older islands, implying ongoing community relaxation and that extinctions are driven more by interspecific competition than environmental filtering. Island time-since-isolation emerges as the strongest predictor of phylogenetic diversity, indicating that longer isolation drives higher phylogenetic diversity via selective extinction of close relatives. These results underline the significance of relaxation dynamics in shaping insular communities.},
