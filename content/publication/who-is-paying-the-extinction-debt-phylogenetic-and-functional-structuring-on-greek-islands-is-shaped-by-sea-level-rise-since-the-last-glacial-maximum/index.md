abstract: Since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)~ 21.5 kya, global sea-level rise has
  reshaped islands by contracting areas, fragmentation, and severing mainland connections.
  These changes led to supersaturation of island communities, triggering community
  relaxation through local extinctions. However, whether local extinctions occur randomly
  or deterministically remains unclear. Here, we integrate a paleo-coastline model
  with well-characterised squamate community data from 163 Mediterranean islands to
  assess how past geographical changes influenced community structure. We evaluate
  phylogenetic and functional community structure and test links to paleogeographic
  variables using multivariate regressions. Our findings suggest overdispersion dominates
  and is higher on older islands, implying ongoing community relaxation and that extinctions
  are driven more by interspecific competition than environmental filtering. Island
  time-since-isolation emerges as the strongest predictor of phylogenetic diversity,
  indicating that longer isolation drives higher phylogenetic diversity via selective
  extinction of close relatives. These results underline the significance of relaxation
  dynamics in shaping insular communities.
