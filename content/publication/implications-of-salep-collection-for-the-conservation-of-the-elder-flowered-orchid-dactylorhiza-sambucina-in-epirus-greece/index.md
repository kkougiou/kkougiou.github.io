abstract: In Epirus, Greece, orchids have been traditionally harvested for the production
  of salep, a beverage made from their tubers. Over-collection of orchids for salep
  is believed to be a growing threat to wild species, yet very little research has
  concentrated on orchid populations in the wild. Here, we studied the impact of salep
  collection on population demographic parameters and uniformity of distribution patterns
  of the Elder-flowered orchid, Dactylorhiza sambucina, the most commonly collected
  orchid in northern Greece.We carried out fieldwork in four meadows where salep harvesting
  occurs, and conducted interviews in villages close to these sites. Fieldwork focused
  on the demographic parameters of orchid populations and on the characteristics of
  their habitat (natural-anthropogenic). We also measured population size and â€¦
