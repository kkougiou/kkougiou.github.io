abstract: Tourism is a phenomenon that dates back to ancient times. Ancient Greek
  philosophers recognised, adopted, and promoted the concept of rest-based tourism.
  Ecotourism is a particular type of tourism that connects with activities that take
  place in nature, without harming it, along with the herbal and animal wealth. According
  to estimates, the global ecotourism industry is currently booming due to various
  reasons, and it is becoming an important factor of sustainable regional development.
  This article presents the vision, work, and outcomes of project AdVENt, a project
  focusing natively in sustainable ecotourism through natural science and technological
  innovation. AdVENt’s study area includes the National Parks of Oiti (or Oeta) and
  Parnassus in Central Greece, where there is a remarkable native flora with a high
  endemism rate integrated with areas of cultural value and national and European
  hiking routes and paths of varying difficulty.
