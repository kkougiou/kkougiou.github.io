  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate and land-use change pose major threats to island floras worldwide, yet few studies integrate these drivers in a single vulnerability assessment. Here, we examine the endemic flora of Evvia, the second largest Aegean island in Greece and an important biodiversity hotspot, as a model system to address how these disturbances may reshape biodiversity patterns. We used species distribution models integrating climate projections and dynamic land-use data to forecast potential range shifts, habitat fragmentation, and biodiversity patterns for 74 endemic taxa through 2100. Our findings reveal pronounced projected range contractions and increased habitat fragmentation for all studied taxa, with more severe impacts on single-island endemics. Current biodiversity hotspots, primarily located in mountainous regions, are expected to shift towards lowland areas, probably becoming extinction â€¦},
