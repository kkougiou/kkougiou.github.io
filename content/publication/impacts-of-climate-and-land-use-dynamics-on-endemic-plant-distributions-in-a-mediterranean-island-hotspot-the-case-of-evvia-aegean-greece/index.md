abstract: Anthropogenic climate and land-use change pose major threats to island floras
  worldwide, yet few studies integrate these drivers in a single vulnerability assessment.
  Here, we examine the endemic flora of Evvia, the second largest Aegean island in
  Greece and an important biodiversity hotspot, as a model system to address how these
  disturbances may reshape biodiversity patterns. We used species distribution models
  integrating climate projections and dynamic land-use data to forecast potential
  range shifts, habitat fragmentation, and biodiversity patterns for 74 endemic taxa
  through 2100. Our findings reveal pronounced projected range contractions and increased
  habitat fragmentation for all studied taxa, with more severe impacts on single-island
  endemics. Current biodiversity hotspots, primarily located in mountainous regions,
  are expected to shift towards lowland areas, probably becoming extinction â€¦
