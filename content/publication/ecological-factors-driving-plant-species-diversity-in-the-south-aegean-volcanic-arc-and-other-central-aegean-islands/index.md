abstract: 'Background: The South Aegean Volcanic Arc (SAVA), one of the most notable
  geological structures of the Mediterranean Sea, is floristically well known. Nevertheless,
  the factors that contribute to shaping the plant species richness of the SAVA remain
  unclear.Aims: To investigate the factors that affect plant species richness and
  identify plant diversity hotspots in the SAVA and other central Aegean islands.Methods:
  We used stepwise multiple regression to test the relationship between a number of
  environmental factors and plant species richness in the SAVA, as well as the residuals
  from the species–area linear regressions of native, Greek and Cycladian endemic
  taxa as indicators of relative species richness.Results: The area was confirmed
  to be the most powerful single explanatory variable of island species richness,
  while geodiversity, maximum elevation and mean annual precipitation explained a
  large …'
