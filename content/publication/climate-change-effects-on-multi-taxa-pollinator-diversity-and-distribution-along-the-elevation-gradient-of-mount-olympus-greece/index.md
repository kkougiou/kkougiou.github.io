abstract: Climate change is predicted to dramatically affect mountain biodiversity
  and especially mountain pollination systems due to the mutual dependence between
  plants and pollinators. In this work, we investigate climate change effects on pollinator
  distribution and diversity along the altitudinal gradient of Mt. Olympus, a biodiversity
  hotspot.We used a species distribution modelling framework and predicted species
  richness hotspots, potential distribution and altitude change for 114 pollinator
  species, comprising bees, butterflies, and hoverflies along the altitudinal gradient
  (327–2596 m a.s.l.).We projected potential loss of suitable habitat and upward shift
  for most pollinator groups, with the exception of bumblebees and hoverflies which
  were predicted to descend. Pollinator extinctions were not forecasted; instead,
  we observed a pronounced species-specific response to climate change. Species richness
  hotspots will be …
