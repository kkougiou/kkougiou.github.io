abstract: Endemic island species face heightened extinction risk from climate-driven
  shifts, yet standard models often underestimate threat levels for those like Quercus
  alnifolia, an iconic Cypriot oak with pre-adaptations to aridity. Through species
  distribution modelling, we investigated the potential shifts in its distribution
  under future climate and land-use change scenarios. Our approach uniquely combines
  dispersal constraints, detailed soil characteristics, hydrological factors, and
  anticipated soil erosion data, offering a comprehensive assessment of environmental
  suitability. We quantified the species’ sensitivity, exposure, and vulnerability
  to projected changes, conducting a preliminary IUCN extinction risk assessment according
  to Criteria A and B. Our projections uniformly predict range reductions, with a
  median decrease of 67.8% by the 2070s under the most extreme scenarios. Additionally,
  our research indicates Quercus alnifolia’s resilience to diverse erosion conditions
  and preference for relatively dry climates within a specific annual temperature
  range. The preliminary IUCN risk assessment designates Quercus alnifolia as Critically
  Endangered in the future, highlighting the need for focused conservation efforts.
  Climate and land-use changes are critical threats to the species’ survival, emphasising
  the importance of comprehensive modelling techniques and the urgent requirement
  for dedicated conservation measures to safeguard this iconic species.
