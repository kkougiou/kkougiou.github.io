abstract: The intra-generic relationships within the intriguing genus Petrorhagia
  are currently debated, as the genus is underrepresented in recent taxonomic studies.
  In this study, we investigate the relationships among the species of Petrorhagia
  [sect. Petrorhagia] subsect. Saxifragae occurring in Greece. Based on a combination
  of ordination methods and discriminant analyses of 36 macromorphological characters,
  five species are recognized in Greece. The analyses showed that all currently known
  species from Greece (P. fasciculata, P. graminea, P. phthiotica and P. saxifraga)
  represent distinct taxonomic entities. According to our results, two recently collected
  populations from SE Peloponnisos represent a fifth, new Petrorhagia species, which
  is first described and illustrated here as P. laconica. It is related to the widespread
  P. saxifraga and the Greek endemic P. graminea, but clearly distinct from both species
