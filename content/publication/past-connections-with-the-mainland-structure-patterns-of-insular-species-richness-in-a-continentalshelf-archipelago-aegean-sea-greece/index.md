abstract: 'Recent research in island biogeography has highlighted the important role
  of late Quaternary sea‐level fluctuations in shaping biogeographic patterns in insular
  systems but focused on oceanic systems. Through this study, we aim investigate how
  late Quaternary sea‐level fluctuations shaped species richness patterns in continental‐shelf
  island systems. Focusing on the Aegean archipelago, we first compiled maps of the
  area''s geography using published data, under three sea‐level stands: (a) current;
  (b) median sea‐level over the last nine glacial–interglacial cycles (MSL); and (c)
  Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We gathered taxon–island occurrences for multiple chorotypes
  of angiosperms, butterflies, centipedes, and reptiles. We investigated the impact
  of present‐day and past geographic settings on chorological groups by analyzing
  island species–area relationships (ISARs) and using generalized linear mixed …'
