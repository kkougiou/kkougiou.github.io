abstract: The Aegean Archipelago has been the focal research area for identifying
  and testing several ecological and evolutionary patterns, yet its biogeographical
  subdivision has been somewhat overlooked, with the processes driving the assembly
  of the Aegean island plant communities still remaining largely unclear. To bridge
  this gap, we identify the biogeographical modules (highly linked subgroups of islands
  and plant taxa) within the Aegean Archipelago.The Aegean Archipelago, Greece.We
  used a network approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based
  on a large and detailed database including 1498 Aegean endemic and subendemic plant
  taxa distributed on 59 Aegean Islands and five adjacent mainland areas.The Aegean
  was divided into six biogeographical modules; the network was significantly modular.
  None of the modules displayed all four â€¦
