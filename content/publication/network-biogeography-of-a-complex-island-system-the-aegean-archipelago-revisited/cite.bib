  abstract = {The Aegean Archipelago has been the focal research area for identifying and testing several ecological and evolutionary patterns, yet its biogeographical subdivision has been somewhat overlooked, with the processes driving the assembly of the Aegean island plant communities still remaining largely unclear. To bridge this gap, we identify the biogeographical modules (highly linked subgroups of islands and plant taxa) within the Aegean Archipelago.The Aegean Archipelago, Greece.We used a network approach to detect island biogeographical roles and modules, based on a large and detailed database including 1498 Aegean endemic and subendemic plant taxa distributed on 59 Aegean Islands and five adjacent mainland areas.The Aegean was divided into six biogeographical modules; the network was significantly modular. None of the modules displayed all four â€¦},
