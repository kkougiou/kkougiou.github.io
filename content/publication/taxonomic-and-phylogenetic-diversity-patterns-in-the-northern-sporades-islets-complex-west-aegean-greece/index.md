abstract: The Aegean archipelago has long been the main research area of numerous
  biogeographers, plant ecologists and taxonomists due to its intricate palaeogeography
  and high environmental and topographical heterogeneity. Nevertheless, some parts
  of this archipelago are essentially unexplored and the processes driving spatial
  variation in species composition remain unaddressed. Aiming to fill these gaps,
  we investigated the flora and plant diversity patterns of the Northern Sporades
  island group, as well as its biogeographical relationships. The study area lies
  in the biogeographical region of the West Aegean islands and comprises 23 islands
  and islets. The total flora of the study area consists of 1202 infrageneric taxa,
  belonging to 517 genera and 120 families, reflecting its geographical and bioclimatic
  characteristics. The endemic element consists of 41 taxa (3.4% of the flora), eight
  of which are restricted to the â€¦
