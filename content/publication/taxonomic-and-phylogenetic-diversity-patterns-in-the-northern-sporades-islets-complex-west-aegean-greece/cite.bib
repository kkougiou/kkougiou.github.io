  abstract = {The Aegean archipelago has long been the main research area of numerous biogeographers, plant ecologists and taxonomists due to its intricate palaeogeography and high environmental and topographical heterogeneity. Nevertheless, some parts of this archipelago are essentially unexplored and the processes driving spatial variation in species composition remain unaddressed. Aiming to fill these gaps, we investigated the flora and plant diversity patterns of the Northern Sporades island group, as well as its biogeographical relationships. The study area lies in the biogeographical region of the West Aegean islands and comprises 23 islands and islets. The total flora of the study area consists of 1202 infrageneric taxa, belonging to 517 genera and 120 families, reflecting its geographical and bioclimatic characteristics. The endemic element consists of 41 taxa (3.4% of the flora), eight of which are restricted to the â€¦},
